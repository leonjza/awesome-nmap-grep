# awesome-nmap-grep

A collection of awesome, _grep-like_ commands for the `nmap` greppable output
(`-oG`) format. This repository aims to serve as a quick reference to modify the
 output into readable formats.

All of the below commands assume the output was saved to a file called
`output.grep`.

## count number of open ports

```bash
$ egrep -v "^#|Status: Up" output.grep | cut -d' ' -f2 -f4- | \
